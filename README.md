# 7th-Semester-Project
It is a Machine learning project to detect crimes occurring in a city and to analyze them. In this dataset we have columns such as- Occurence date, month, reporting
date , Neighborhood, type of offence, MCI (or Major Crime Indicators). This would help in clearly showcasing which neighbourhood are dangerous and require more focus of police agencies. It would also supplement to the general publicâ€™s knowledge for their own well-being and safety.
