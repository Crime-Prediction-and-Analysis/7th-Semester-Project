# 7th-Semester-Project
It is a Machine learning project to detect crimes occurring in a city and to analyze them. In this dataset we have columns such as- Occurence date, month, reporting
date , Neighborhood, type of offence, MCI (or Major Crime Indicators). This would help in clearly showcasing which neighbourhood are dangerous and require more focus of police agencies. It would also supplement to the general publicâ€™s knowledge for their own well-being and safety. Our study aims to find spatial and temporal criminal hotspots and also forcasting of crime using a set of real-world datasets of crimes. We will try to locate the most likely crime locations and their frequent occurrence time.In addition, we will predict what type of crime might occur next in a specific location within a particular time. Finally, we intend to provide an analysis study by combining our findings of a particular crimes dataset with its demographics information.
